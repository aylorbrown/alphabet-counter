Create a new React + Redux application that is very similar to the Counter app, but 

- Instead of showing a number, show the letter of the alphabet 
- The first time you render, show the letter 'm'
- When the user clocks the + button, the letter should change to 'n'
- If the user click the + button again, the letter should change to 'o'
- If the user then clicks the - button, the letter should change to 'n' 

When the letter being shown is 'a' and the users clicks -, the letter should change to 'z'

Likewise, if the letter shown is 'z' and the user clicks +, the letter should change to 'a'
